<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vodka pasta, also known as penne alla vodka, is a delectable Italian dish that combines the richness of creamy tomato sauce with the smoothness of vodka. This tantalizing creation starts with al dente penne pasta cooked to perfection, which is then tossed in a velvety sauce made from ripe tomatoes, garlic, onions, and a generous splash of vodka. The vodka not only adds a subtle, unique flavor but also helps to enhance the overall creaminess of the sauce. As the pasta absorbs the flavors, it becomes infused with the delightful essence of tomatoes and herbs, while the vodka brings a delightful warmth to each bite. The dish is often garnished with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese or fresh basil, adding a final touch of richness and freshness. With its harmonious blend of flavors and luxurious texture, vodka pasta is a true indulgence for pasta lovers seeking a delightful twist on traditional Italian cuisine.</p>

    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup (240 ml) tomato puree or crushed tomatoes
    </li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) vodka
    </li>
    <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust according to your spice preference)

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the penne pasta and cook it according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Sauté the onions and garlic: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté them until they become soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Prepare the sauce: Pour in the tomato puree or crushed tomatoes into the skillet with the onions and garlic. Stir well to combine. Then, add the vodka and continue to cook for another 2 minutes to allow the alcohol to evaporate.</li>
    <li>Add the cream and spices: Reduce the heat to low and pour in the heavy cream. Stir the sauce gently to incorporate the cream. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>Combine the pasta and sauce: Add the cooked penne pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce until it is evenly coated. Allow it to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, to ensure that the pasta absorbs the flavors.</li>
    <li>Serve: Once the vodka pasta is ready, remove it from the heat. Transfer it to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with freshly chopped basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
