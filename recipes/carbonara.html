<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces (225 grams) of spaghetti or bucatini pasta</li>
    <li>4 ounces (113 grams) pancetta or bacon, diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup (100 grams) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Chopped parsley (for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti or bucatini pasta and cook it according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving a small amount of the cooking water, and set it aside.</li>
    <li>Sauté the pancetta or bacon: In a skillet, cook the diced pancetta or bacon over medium heat until it becomes crispy and golden. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute.</li>
    <li>Prepare the sauce: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li>Toss the pasta: Remove the skillet with the pancetta or bacon from the heat. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss it with the pancetta or bacon until well coated. Allow the skillet to cool for a minute or two to avoid scrambling the eggs when they are added.</li>
    <li>Add the sauce: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta in the skillet. Toss the pasta continuously to coat it evenly with the sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy and glossy texture.</li>
    <li>Season and serve: Season with salt to taste. If needed, add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen the sauce. Transfer the carbonara pasta to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately while still hot and enjoy!</li>
